## Interval Workout Timer (iOS)
This is a simple, clean interval workout timer built in Swift for iOS.
The goal of the project is to combine a minimal and intuitive UI with core app functionality such as timed intervals, progress display, and customizable workout sessions.

The app is being developed as part of my ongoing learning in iOS development.

## Features (in progress)

- Basic interval timer structure

- First screen layout built in Swift / UIKit

- Start / stop button preparation

- Visual countdown UI planned

- Customizable interval settings planned (work time, rest time, rounds)

## Project Goals

Practice structuring an iOS project from scratch outside of guided tutorials

Improve understanding of UIKit layouts, Auto Layout, and view hierarchy

Implement timers using Timer and explore background execution options

Apply clean code principles and prepare for later architectural patterns (MVVM or Clean Swift)

## Tech & Tools

- Swift

- Xcode

- UIKit

- Auto Layout

## Status

The project is currently in its early development stage.
The first screen UI is implemented, and functionality is being added incrementally.

## Roadmap

- Add interval configuration screen

- Implement active timer with visual progress

- Add sound / vibration cues

- Persist user settings

- Improve UI/UX animations

- Add simple history tracking (optional)
